// whole window surface per presented frame (see gdk_cairo_draw_from_gl's
// alpha path), previously paid once per *video* frame.

// stacking, however, are *parent* state and only take effect on a parent
// commit, which is why SetRect() asks the view to redraw.
//
// mpv is never told about Wayland: it only ever sees the EGL surface's default
